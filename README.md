# Parking Prediction (Smarking Challenge)

## Description
This is a [micro Bittiger project](https://www.bittiger.io/microproject/jEaqRv4rurDJ6BhNm) provided by Smarking Inc, and it's part of the application for their software engineering position. We will use the given data set to build prediction models and provide an interactive web application for users to observe predicted results, upload actual data, compare the real and predicted data, and check the accuracy.


## Plan

### Todo List
- [ ] Data Analysis
- [ ] Prediction Model Building
- [ ] Interactive Web Visulization
