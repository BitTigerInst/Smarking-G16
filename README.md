Smarking Challenge Project: Parking Prediction, Group 16

***
# Parking Prediction (Smarking Challenge)

## Description
This is a [micro Bittiger project](https://www.bittiger.io/microproject/jEaqRv4rurDJ6BhNm) provided by Smarking, and it's part of the application for their software engineering position. We will use the given date set to build prediction models and provide an interactive web page for users to observe predicted result, upload actural data, compare the real and predicted data, and check the accuracy.

## Plan

### Todo List
- [ ] Data Analysis
- [ ] Prediction Model Building
- [ ] Interactive Web Visulization
